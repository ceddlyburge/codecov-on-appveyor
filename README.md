# Integrating CodeCov and AppVeyor 

Companion repository to the blog post [CodeCov Test Coverage Integration](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2017/03/17/codecov/) on the AppVeyor website.

The post is written from the point of view of someone (me) who is already proficient in C# and unit testing, but was new to AppVeyor and integrating CodeCov with GitHub.

It contains from scratch steps to upload test coverage to [CodeCov](http://codecov.io/) for a sample C# project using [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) and [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover). 

This is the repo that I created to test the blog post, which you can use for clues if you have trouble following the instructions in the post.

Obviously, it being a post about Code Coverage, there is a badge to display the results :)
